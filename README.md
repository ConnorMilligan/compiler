## Binary compiler
This proved to be challenging, but actually quite fun to do. Being unfamiliar with the purpose of the runtime C files, it was interesting to actually figure out why they were there. When it came to the actual implementation, it was mostly just going through the actual main function, which had remained untouched in previous projects until now. Looking through the code, it seemed that the compiler already just outputted assembly code without any sort of compilation. This made adding the `-S` flag trivial. On that note as well, the actual flags proved to be quite easy with the help of a python library. For the `-o` flag, it was simple just to substitute the default output filename with a variable set by the flag. Now with assembly output and output names done, it came time to tackle the actual compilation. First matter of business was an assembler, I had originally chosen to use NASM, as it is an assembler I had worked with in the past, but I quickly realized that the output of the compiler follows AT&T syntax. This actually proved to be a good thing, as I could simply use the GNU assembler. Considering I was already planning on using the linker provided in GCC, this helped simplify dependencies. The rest of the task was simply writing a function that acted not unlike a shell script, just excepting commands that were required to compile as I would do so manually. With all that done, all the features I had envisioned for this feature were done. Using a library called pyinstaller (Added to a requirements.txt), I was able to condense the project into a simple binary which could be thrown into the a folder on a systems path and run independently from the command line. While the program does output valid binaries, they are unable to run due to a failing assertion, something about the rootstock size doesn't seem to be working, which could be a local issue, but I was unfortunately unable to figure it out.
